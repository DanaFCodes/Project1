Technical wins... Made a responsive multi-page website!! So proud of myself, sending this link to my mom after class :) 

Many (manyðŸ™ƒ) technical issues, mostly in the responsivness -- in the future I really hope to master flex:shrink/flex:grow as I feel these properties could have saved me and my soul a lot of struggle. Nevertheless, tried to use as many fluid units of measurment (percentages + rem) which had its pros and cons. A very informative expereience overall! Going forward, I will aim to use flex more to its advantage, and rely less on margin-left to save my a$$.
